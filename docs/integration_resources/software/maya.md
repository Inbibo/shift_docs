## Running Shift in Maya

Shift provides a `mshift` utility script to properly bind the Shift UI to Maya. In order to run and open Shift in Maya, execute the following code block inside the Maya *Python Script Editor*:

<pre><code style="white-space: pre; padding: 10px; box-sizing: border-box;">import sys
sys.path.append("&ltpath_to_the_shift_installation_folder&gt")
sys.path.append("&ltpath_to_the_shift_installation_folder&gt/shift/thirdparty/python/Lib/site-packages")

from shift.tools import mshift
mshift.show()
</code></pre>


## Python Interpreter Setup
In Shift it is possible to launch the execution of a workflow via an application's Python interpreter with the [WorkflowProcess](../reference/nodes/workflow/#workflowProcess-node) node. To achieve this for Maya, set path to its Python interpreter the following environment variable:

**SHIFT_PROCESS_MAYA** : path to Mayaâ€™s Python interpreter (mayapy)

## Catalogs

Shift provides some catalogs with operators specific to work within Maya. Most of these nodes are found in the *CreativeSofware* catalog. Additionally, the following Shift catalogs also provide support specific nodes for Maya:
