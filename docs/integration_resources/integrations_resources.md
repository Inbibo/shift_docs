# Integrations & Resources

One of Shift's key features is its ability to be integrated with multiple applications and adopt many different APIs. 

Given that Shift is entirely built in Python, it can be used to create and execute workflows in any software capable of running a Python process. This enables interoperability across various software platforms and the creation of graphs that are specific to an application. This way, with Shift it is possible to integrate functionalities of different software into one single process. On the other hand, some of Shift's operators are developed to be compatible with multiple software (tailored mostly to Digital Creative Content applications), granting the possibility of using a single workflow to achieve the same results on different platforms.


Shift also offers an extensive range of catalogs that allow the integration of multiple Python APIs and modules, such as USD or Ftrack. These catalogs are public so that users and developers can download and use them for their workflows or extend them to meet their individual needs.

As Shift continues growing, more integrations and resources will come.
