# Introduction

Shift is a node-based low-code automation software entirely written in Python.  
With Shift you can create your own automation [workflows](intro/terminology.md/#workflow), and share them with others.

You can use the built-in catalogs to start creating your workflows or write your own with the Shift [API](dev_help/shift/api_standalone.md)
