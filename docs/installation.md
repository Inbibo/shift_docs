# Installation

To install Shift on your machine simply download the .zip file build for the Python version of your liking from the [website](https://https://www.inbibo.co.uk/shift). Shift ditributions come with their own Python interpreter with all the required third-party libraries already packaged.

Once you have the folder simply unzip it in the location that you prefer and double-click on the `shift.bat` file to run it.

To run Shift using a custom Python interpreter check the [requrements page](requirements.md).
