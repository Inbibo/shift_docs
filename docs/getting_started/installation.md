# Installation

To install Shift, download the *.zip* file corresponding to the preferred Python version from the [website](https://https://www.inbibo.co.uk/shift). Shift distributions packages come with a built-in Python interpreter, along with all necessary third-party libraries to use Shift and its native catalogs.

After downloading the package, unzip the folder to the desired location and double-click the `shift.bat` file to launch the application.

For running Shift with a custom Python interpreter, refer to the  [requirements](requirements.md) page.
