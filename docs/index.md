# Introduction

Welcome to Shift's documentation where we provide you with all the information you need to use the software to create workflows to automate tasks. If you need more information or help, please do not hesitate to send an email to shiftsupport@inbibo.co.uk .

## Key Values 

Shift is a node-based low-code automation software entirely written in Python.  
With Shift you can use catalogs of operators, or prototype your own, connect them, and intuitively build workflows to run complex processes to automate your work. Shift is a Python based application and has the potential to build anything that has Python language compatibility.

- **Easy to Use**: Most automation in VFX, Animation and Video Games relies on people with software development skills. Shift's node-based approach is more familiar to many digital artists and technical directors, allowing everyone to intuitively contribute to the technology stack.
- **Lean & Scalable**: Working with many interconnected pipeline scripts makes it difficult to follow the pace enforced by production. Using operators, catalogs, or plugins and working with processes as assets (instead of software) allows to rapidly adapt and address any production or business requirement.

## Why Shift?

With Shift you can:

- Better understand, configure, and scale complex processes.
- Create custom operators to adapt to the needs of specific scenarios.
- Improve efficiency at authoring workflows in your pipeline.
- Allow non-technical teams to quickly sketch their automation with the abstraction that they need.
