# Logger

The Shift Logger logs any message raised by Shift, errors and warnings from nodes, missing configurations or exceptions raised by the application itself. Messages can be inspected through the [Logger widget](../getting_started/basics/ui_overview/#the-logger), although they are also recorded in the terminal where Shift launches or in the log files generated by the app.


## Log Levels

The log level determines which messages will be logged depending on its criticality. Depending on the log level, the message may be color coded in the widget.

**Log Levels**

|Log Level|Description|Color|
|:--|:---|:--|
|DEBUG | Technical information about execution processes, usually useful for developers when trying to diagnose an issue. | No color
|INFO | General information about execution processes indicating that are they working as expected.| No color
|WARNING | Information about a behavior that might not be the expected one and might cause issues in the near future. | Yellow
|ERROR | Information about a process that has not been able to execute successfully. Errors are usually handled by Shift and indicate the source of the problem.| Red
|CRITICAL| Information about a process that has not been able to execute successfully due to a serious problem. Exceptions not handled by Shift are considered critical.| Red
|LOG | Logs from the Logger itself, usually indicating that Shift has started properly. These messages always print. | No color

By default, when opening Shift the Logger is set to the *Warning* level. The level can be changed via the UI, by choosing the preferred log level under the `View -> Log Level` options in the top menu bar.


>[!NOTE]
>If persistent critical errors are experienced, please, [contact support](https://inbibo.co.uk/contact?_gl=1*m7h22j*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU4MzcxNTg4OS4xNzI0MzE2MTQ2*_ga_DY05R1LZDB*MTcyNDMxNjE0Ni4xLjEuMTcyNDMxNjE1Mi4wLjAuMTg0MTg0MzEwNw..) attaching the error message and providing a description of the issue.


## Log Files

All messages caught by the Logger are recorded in log files. Shift uses a rotating file handler, meaning that new logs will be created when the file exceeds a specific size without exceeding a set number of backups. By default, the log files can be found in the OS's default temporary directory:

> [!NOTE = Temporary Folder]
> === Windows
> 
> `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`
>
>  === Linux
>
> `/tmp`

## Configuring the Logger

The default configuration settings of the Logger can be changed by defining the following environment variables:

|Environment Variable| Description | Fallback Value |
|:--|:---|:--|
|`SHIFT_LOG_LEVEL`| The default log level when starting Shift.| "*WARNING*"
|`SHIFT_LOG_MAXSIZE`| The maximum size of the log files in MB.| "*10485760*"
|`SHIFT_LOG_MAXFILES`| The maximum number of log files.| "*5*"
|`SHIFT_LOG_DIRECTORY`| The location of log files.| OS's default temporary directory.

>[!NOTE]
> If the maximum size or the maximum number of files is 0, Shift will generate a unique log file with no size limit.
